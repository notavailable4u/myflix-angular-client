# MyFlix - A movie database app built with Angular

This project was created as part of the curriculum for the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Career Foundry] (https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) [^1]. It is a client-side / Front-End, User Interface, built  with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5 and Google's Material Design for previously created server-side component of a movie themed MEAN Single Page Application. Currently hosted on GitHub Pages.

Pre-existing Server Side Back-End source code can be viewed here: (https://github.com/notavailable4u/movie_api-2).

[^1]: If you are considering enrolling in the Full Stack Web Development Program at Career Foundry, I cannot strongly enough caution you to NOT ENROLL. The lessons are filled with so much deprecated code and blatant errors that it is criminal. Feel free to contact me if you would like more detailed information.
